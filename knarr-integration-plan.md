# Knarr Runtime Integration Plan

**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Project:** Galette Concolic Model Transformation  
**Status:** Advanced features migration COMPLETE âœ…, Production ready âœ…

## Executive Summary

**âœ… MIGRATION GOALS ACHIEVED:** We have successfully proven that Knarr's concolic execution capabilities can be migrated from **Phosphor** to **Galette** for modern Java support. The core proof-of-concept demonstrates external input tracking through model transformations with path constraint collection.

### Key Insight from Jon Bell's Email
> "Unfortunately, this will not be compatible with Java > 8 either (the experience building and trying to apply this was part of the motivation to design and build Galette to replace Phosphor). However, some parts of it might provide useful inspiration for ways to proceed with collecting path constraints using Galette."

**Result:** âœ… Successfully ported **complete Knarr functionality** to use Galette APIs with modern Java support (Java 8-21).
