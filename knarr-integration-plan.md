# Knarr Runtime Integration Plan

**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Project:** Galette Concolic Model Transformation  
**Status:** Core migration COMPLETE ✅, Advanced features PENDING ⏳

## Executive Summary

**✅ MIGRATION GOALS ACHIEVED:** We have successfully proven that Knarr's concolic execution capabilities can be migrated from **Phosphor** to **Galette** for modern Java support. The core proof-of-concept demonstrates external input tracking through model transformations with path constraint collection.

### Key Insight from Jon Bell's Email
> "Unfortunately, this will not be compatible with Java > 8 either (the experience building and trying to apply this was part of the motivation to design and build Galette to replace Phosphor). However, some parts of it might provide useful inspiration for ways to proceed with collecting path constraints using Galette."

**Result:** ✅ Successfully ported core Knarr functionality to use Galette APIs with modern Java support (Java 8-21).

## Migration Status: 60% Complete

### ❌ MISSING ADVANCED FEATURES

Based on comparison with original `knarr/` folder, significant gaps remain:

#### 1. Array Symbolic Execution ❌
- **Missing:** `TaintListener.java` (485 lines) - Complex array operation handling
- **Impact:** Cannot perform symbolic execution on array operations
- **Gap:** Array reads, writes, index tracking, multi-dimensional arrays

#### 2. String Symbolic Execution ❌
- **Missing:** `StringUtils.java` (572 lines) - String constraint handling
- **Impact:** String operations not symbolically tracked
- **Gap:** String concatenation, substring operations, character-level constraints

#### 3. Coverage Tracking ❌
- **Missing:** `Coverage.java`, `AFLCoverage.java` - Code coverage for test generation
- **Impact:** Cannot track branch coverage for comprehensive testing
- **Gap:** Fuzzing integration, coverage-guided test generation

#### 4. Advanced Instrumentation ❌
- **Missing:** Multiple bytecode adapters
  - `CountBytecodeAdapter.java`
  - `RedirectMethodsTaintAdapter.java`
  - `KnarrAutoTainter.java`
- **Impact:** Limited bytecode instrumentation capabilities
- **Gap:** Automatic taint propagation, method redirection, advanced transformations

#### 5. Testing Infrastructure ❌
- **Missing:** `JunitTestAdapter.java`, `JunitAssert.java`
- **Impact:** No symbolic testing framework integration
- **Gap:** Automated test generation, assertion checking

#### 6. Constraint Generation ❌
- **Missing:** `PathConstraintTagFactory.java`, `StringTagFactory.java`
- **Impact:** Limited constraint type support
- **Gap:** Complex constraint types, string constraints, custom constraint factories

## Current Capabilities vs. Gaps

### ✅ What Works Now
- **Basic symbolic execution** with numeric values
- **Path constraint collection** for simple conditionals
- **Model transformation integration** with external inputs
- **Clean architecture** separation of business logic and symbolic execution
- **Green solver integration** for basic constraint solving
- **Modern Java support** (Java 8-21)

### ❌ What's Missing for Production Use
- **Array operations** - Cannot handle `array[symbolic_index] = value`
- **String operations** - Cannot handle `string.substring(symbolic_start, symbolic_end)`
- **Coverage tracking** - Cannot measure test coverage
- **Fuzzing integration** - No AFL or other fuzzer support
- **Advanced constraints** - Limited to basic numeric comparisons

## Recommendations

### For Research Use (Current State)
**Status:** ✅ READY - Core migration goals achieved

The current implementation successfully demonstrates:
- External input impact analysis in model transformations
- Modern Java version support (solving original problem)
- Clean architecture for integration with existing systems
- Proof-of-concept for Galette's suitability

### For Production Use
