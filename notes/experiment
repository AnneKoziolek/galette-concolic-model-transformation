Cannot statically instrument:
dacapo-23.11-chopin/dat/lib/daytrader/wildfly-26.1.3.Final/standalone/deployments/daytrader-ear-3.0-SNAPSHOT.ear
    Reason:  org.jboss.jandex.Indexer
    Benchmark: tradebeans
dacapo-23.11-chopin/jar/h2o/h2o.jar
    Benchmark: h2o
Possibly others

Disk usage issues:
46 = mirror-taint,biojava
59 = mirror-taint,spring

Why are the results for cassandra missing?
Defect in DaCapo: https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench/issues/211
The Cassandra benchmark was excluded due to an defect that impacted the benchmark in the 23.11 Chopin release of DaCapo (https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench/issues/211)

Which tasks have not finished?
* Phosphor times out on tradesoap and tradebeans due to removal of DaCapo imposed timeout

Reset for disk space:
mirror-taint,biojava,44
    4.6G	./mirrorTaint/20240423173135/agent-info.log
mirror-taint,spring,56

Is MirrorTaint applying tags automatically?
As far as I can tell the sources that MirrorTaint uses are application specific and, therefore, unlikely to apply to the
DaCapo subjects.
