Why are the results for cassandra missing?
Defect in DaCapo: https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench/issues/211

Which tasks have not finished?
* Phosphor loops infinitely on tradesoap and tradebeans due to removal of DaCapo imposed timeout

Is MirrorTaint applying tags automatically?
As far as I can tell the sources that MirrorTaint uses are application specific and, therefore, unlikely to apply to the
DaCapo subjects.

1191447_1424 phosphor,tradebeans
and
1191447_1257 phosphor,tradesoap failed due to disk usage
Disk usage is due to large log (scratch/log/server.log) recording errors:
"2024-04-25 00:00:00,024 ERROR [stderr] (main) Got 404"
