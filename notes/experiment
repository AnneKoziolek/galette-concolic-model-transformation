Disk usage issues:
46 = mirror-taint,biojava
47 = mirror-taint,cassandra

Why are the results for cassandra missing?
Defect in DaCapo: https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench/issues/211
The Cassandra benchmark was excluded due to an defect that impacted the benchmark in the 23.11 Chopin release of DaCapo (https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench/issues/211)

Which tasks have not finished?

Is MirrorTaint applying tags automatically?
As far as I can tell the sources that MirrorTaint uses are application specific and, therefore, unlikely to apply to the
DaCapo subjects.
