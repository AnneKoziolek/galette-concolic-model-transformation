Cannot statically instrument:
dacapo-23.11-chopin/dat/lib/daytrader/wildfly-26.1.3.Final/standalone/deployments/daytrader-ear-3.0-SNAPSHOT.ear
    Reason:  org.jboss.jandex.Indexer
    Benchmark: tradebeans

Possibly others

Why are the results for cassandra missing?
Defect in DaCapo: https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench/issues/211

Which tasks have not finished?
* Phosphor times out on tradesoap and tradebeans due to removal of DaCapo imposed timeout

Is MirrorTaint applying tags automatically?
As far as I can tell the sources that MirrorTaint uses are application specific and, therefore, unlikely to apply to the
DaCapo subjects.
