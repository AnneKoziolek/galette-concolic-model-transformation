Implementation
* [MUST] Improve the performance of array accesses
* [MUST] General performance tuning
* [MUST] Any TODOs in codebase
* [MUST] Debug this https://github.com/neu-se/phosphor2/actions/runs/8676056734/job/23790146937
    *** java.lang.instrument ASSERTION FAILED ***: "!errorOutstanding" with message transform method call failed at JPLISAgent.c line: 844
* [SHOULD] Improve the performance of Unsafe accesses (switch to HashMap)
* [SHOULD] Switch the tag representation from a HashMap to Phosphor's PowerSetTree
* [SHOULD] Create README based on Phosphor's
* [SHOULD] Remove extra entries in stack traces produces from Thread#dumpThread and StackTraceElement#initStackTraceElements
    (remove the shadow wrapper for native methods)
* [SHOULD] Re-examine all masks and consider the implications of subclassing (e.g., what if this method were called
    with a sub or super class reference)
* [SHOULD] Create separate plugin for creating instrumented JDKs (astrolabe), "Utilities for dynamic analysis tools"
* [COULD] Configuration

Functional experiments
* [COULD] Create a detailed listing describing the functional benchmark groups
* [COULD] Add additional tests for MethodHandles
* [COULD] Add tests for pattern matching
* [COULD] Add tests for ternaries
* [COULD] Add tests for String templates
* [SHOULD] Consider making benchmark tests for serialization into integration tests for Galette
* [SHOULD] Determine root cause of failures for Phosphor and MirrorTaint
* [MUST] Write up description of results

Performance experiments
* [MUST] Decide on a methodology of the performance evaluation
    Fork 20 JVMs (trials)
    Perform 3 warm-up iterations (discarded) followed 5 measurement iterations
    If JVM process terminates with non-zero ---> discard
* [MUST] Create a means of recording execution times and sampling the resident set size (RSS) of the DaCapo benchmark process
* [MUST] Create experiment scripts
* [MUST] Create analysis scripts
* [MUST] Write up description of results
* [COULD] Identify locations to use as taint sources manually for each DaCapo subject and apply labels

Other
* [SHOULD] Make full release of Phosphor
* [SHOULD] Contact the MirrorTaint authors about releasing an updated, obfuscated JAR for MirrorTaint containing the fixes I made and a license.
