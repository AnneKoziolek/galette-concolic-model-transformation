Benchmark MirrorTaint Phosphor
	    p A_12      p A_12

For each benchmark, we report the two-tailed, asymptotic \textit{p}-value (\textit{p}) and Vargha-Delaney $\hat{A}_{12}$ statistic ($\hat{A}_{12}$) for Mann-Whitney U tests comparing the execution time of \galette against \mirrortaint and \phosphor.
Values that are statistically significantly (\(\mathit{p} < 0.0167\)) greater than or less than \galette's are colored green and red, respectively.
